## Coding Challenge 3

Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs!
This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations!

### Remember

`BMI = mass / height **2 = mass / (height * height).`
Mass in `kg` and height in `meter`.

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith).
2. Create a `calcBMI` method on each object to calculate the `BMI` (the same method on both objects). Store the `BMI` value to a property, and also return it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI.

### Example:

`"John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!"`

### Test Data:

Marks weighs `78kg` and is `1.69m` tall. John weighs `92kg` and is `1.95m` tall.
